A script to visualize the sensibility of the comparison
quantities (nu and epsilon) respect to a known change in V0
B0 and B1.
Two set of weights are considered for nu:
 nu1 = (1,1,1)  nu2=
The first panel quantifies the 'perfect agreement' = agreement
within the numerical error. The numerical error is assumed to be
the error we see in the kpoints comparison for converged materials.
We therefore select difference on V0 of 0.01 %, difference in B0 of 0.1% and
difference in B1 of 1%.
The other three panael are:
2) Difference in V0 of 2%, no differnce in B0, B1
3) Difference in B0 of 2%, no differnce in V0, B1
4) Difference in B1 of 2%, no differnce in V0, B0
