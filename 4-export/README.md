# Exporting all results

When all is done, you can export all results.

After modifying the `export_results.sh` script to specify your `PLUGIN_NAME`, execute it to create an export file. This can be shared in a common location so one can analyse the results.
We suggest to also provide some of the outputs in the folder `../3-analyze/outputs` (e.g. the PDF collecting all plots, and the text files).
